# Notes :
This application allow you to measure the current and to voltage through the ADS1115. In doc repository you will find the coresponding schematic.  

We wanted to determine the level of battery in real time with **LoRa** thanks the voltage. Moreover we wanted to follow the power consuption with the current.  


The `A0` input is connected to the battery positive output. Then the `A1` input is conected in serial with a 1 Ohm precision resistor.  

This program make the diferential calcul between `A0` and `A1`
